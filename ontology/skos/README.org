SKOS terms for some VarioML ontology elements. Use full URIs  or source /  accession id pairs.  Accession id should be prefixed using
e.g. the id scheme defined in http://identifiers.org/. Source is reserved for identifying the authority responsible for the id scheme


** Example:

  <pathogenicity term="Likely pathogenic"  uri="http://purl.org/varioml/pathogenicity/skos/1.0/#p_0003">
  </pathogenicity>

or

  <pathogenicity term="Likely pathogenic"  source="g2p" accession="p_0003" >
  </pathogenicity>
